# Code for Experimnet 1 & 2

To generate results of Experiment 1 & 2 follow the steps.

- Run `exp_mnist.py` (or `exp_fmnist.py`) with
```
python exp_mnist.py
```
This runs the experiment based on parameters provided in the files and saves the raw results in the `results` folder.

- Then for Experiment 1 open `exp1_plot.ipynb` and run the cells to get the plots.

- For Experiment 2 open `exp2_plot.ipynb` and run the cells to get the plots.

Note that both ipynb files assumes you don't change the `details` variable in files (`exp_minst.py` and `exp_fmnist.py`). If you change the directories or experiment name then provide the same in .ipynb files as well.
